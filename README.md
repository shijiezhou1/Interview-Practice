Run all your test by using 
```node big-o.js```

- algorithm complexity
n - the size of the input complexities ordered in from samllest to largest.

    Big-O
    O(n2)

- sorting
    
    n*log(n)

---
- hashtables

--- 
- trees
    
    traveral and manipulation algorithms (BFS and DFS)
    
        inorder
